@544  = ~The hard plates that protect umber hulks are reasonably easy to craft into humanoid armor. This dark suit of armor was fashioned into plate mail by duergar smiths. The dark dwarves, skilled in handling umber hulk exoskeletons, cured and reinforced the armor.

@546  = ~This armor was made by the dwarven smith Karador and an elven enchanter known as Elameth of Five Trees. During the time of cooperation between the Hand of the Seldarine and Dorn's Deep, many wondrous items were produced. This suit of armor was one of them. Exceptionally light and beautiful, the armor was originally worn by a female elven marshal in the Severed Hand, which is why the orcs didn't take it when they sacked the towers. The armor was later stolen from the Hand by the evil elf Maiden Ilmadia, who wore it in her final battle against the Defenders of Easthaven at Lower Dorn's Deep. What happened to the armor after her defeat and how it traveled from the Spine of the World to the Sword Coast is unclear.

@548  = ~This robe was fashioned from strong fabric and dyed dark blue, the favorite color of its proud owner, the archmage Ogi-Luc. A Sembian by birth, Ogi-Luc was a powerful man, as strong in body as he was in mind. However, Ogi-Luc wasn't content to merely be strong. He wanted to be exceptionally strong. When he put on these robes, proud men stood aside and braggarts stilled their tongues. For all of Ogi-Luc's pride and prowess, he was unable to defeat the Red Wizard abjurer Nesk Vhaltim. Nesk took the robes as a prize. They were later stolen and sold by a daring rogue.
